# Football Tactics Board ⚽

As an avid football fan, I love analyzing team formations and drawing up lineups before big matches. Whether it's predicting how my favorite club will line up for the weekend fixture or theorizing about national team selections for major tournaments, tactical planning is one of my favorite aspects of the beautiful game.

## What is this?

This is a modern, interactive Soccer Tactics Board application built with React and TypeScript. It provides a clean, responsive interface where you can:

- **Position players** on a realistic football pitch using smooth drag-and-drop
- **Switch between teams** (home/away) with distinct colors
- **Apply formations** like 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, and more
- **Reset positions** to quickly try different setups
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

The app features a glassmorphism design with smooth animations and is optimized for performance with modern React patterns.

## Built With

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (lightning-fast build tool)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- @dnd-kit (accessible drag-and-drop)
- Zustand (state management)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to start positioning your players!

## What's Next?

I'm currently exploring adding the ability to **load historical lineups** from various clubs and national teams across different years. Imagine being able to instantly load:

- Brazil's 2002 World Cup winning formation
- Barcelona's 2009 Champions League final lineup
- Your favorite club's formation from their title-winning season
- Classic formations from football history

This would make the app not just a tactical planning tool, but also a way to explore and learn from football's greatest teams and moments.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production  
npm run lint         # Run linting
```
